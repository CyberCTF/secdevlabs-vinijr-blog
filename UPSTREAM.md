The app folder [`owasp-top10-2021-apps/a5/vinijr-blog`](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs/tree/10be438496e928c66567749f0aaf0bb976052bc9/owasp-top10-2021-apps/a5/vinijr-blog) of that commit is vendored unchanged, without its Git history,
split so that each part sits in the build folder of the machine that uses it:

| Upstream path (in the app folder) | Here |
| --- | --- |
| everything | `build/app/app/` |

Each `build/<machine>/Dockerfile` says in its header comment how it differs from upstream:

- `build/app/`: upstream's `deployments/Dockerfile` with the base image pinned to `php:8.3-apache` (upstream takes the latest `php:apache`) and the site copied into `/var/www/html`, where upstream's compose file mounts it.

To update, replace the vendored folders with a newer secDevLabs commit, then change this file.
